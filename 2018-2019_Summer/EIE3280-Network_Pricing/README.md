### Description

This course introduces various networking technologies that we use each day and the fundamental principles behind them. Different from many *theory-based* networking courses, this course is organized around a list of intriguing questions about the technological, economic and social aspects of modern networks. The course will broadly cover topics on wireless networks, Internet, social networks, and network economics. We will introduce various methodologies such as graph theory, optimization theory, game theory, and pricing theory. The intended audience of this course are undergraduates in Computer Science, Electronic and Information Engineering. It is also suitable for interested undergraduate students from Mathematics and Social Sciences. Students are expected to have taken math courses covering multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations, and have some training in programming.

## Prerequisites

- ***MAT1001*** Calculus I
- ***MAT1002*** Calculus II
- ***STA2001*** Probability and Statistics I
- ***MAT2002*** Ordinary Differential Equations
