### Uplink Interference

(More like a Binary Symmetric Channel)

However, the basic units in this case is ***not mutual information***, but ***sending/receiving power times the interference to the orthogonal codes*** 

~~(q: 1. physical or symbol level? 2. binary symmetric channel)~~

In ideal CDMA codes, the Uplink Interference equals to zero

#### Signal to Interface Noise Ration (SIR)

$$
SIR_i = \frac{G_{ii}p_i}{\sum_{j\not = i}G_{ij}p_j + n_i}
$$

***unit: Walt***

$p_k$: the transmission power *(how loud you talk to the base stations)* 

$n_k$: noise from various of sources *(something you cannot control & even cannot figure out what they are)*

$\sum$: for all the users at the time

***comments***: suitable for evaluate the quality of CDMA due to the $G_{ij}$ term

***comments ii***: if you enhance your power in transmission, it will cause more interference to other users
$$
\text{Goal:} \frac{G_{ii}p_i}{\sum_{j\not = i}G_{ij}p_j + n_i} \geq r_i \text{(target)}, \forall i
$$

#### Distributed Power Control

- Iterative 
- ***==Distributed== Algorithm***
- Achieve the target SIR with the minimum transmission power

$$
p_i[t+1] = \frac{\gamma_i}{SIR_i[t]}p_i[t], \forall i \\ \gamma_i: \text{SIR target for user i}
$$

*Cannot always converge according to* $\gamma$

***Evaluation of DPC***

- Simple
  - in communication
  - in computation
  - configuration ***(no parameter need to control)***
- Intuitive 
  - Equilibrium looks good
  - Convergence plausible

### A General Theme*

- Individual behaviors ==driven by self-interest==
- Aggregate into a state across all users
- Helped by feedback signals

---

### The View of Optimization

*Classical mathematical problems can be characterized as*

- Objective: $\min\sum p_i$ ***(power minimization)*** 
- Constraints: $SIR_i \geq \gamma_i, \forall i$ ***(achieve target SIRs for all users)***
- Variables: $p_i, \forall i$ ***(transmit powers)***
- Constants (parameters): $G_{ij}, n_i, \gamma_i$ ***(channels, noise, target SIRS)***

#### Terminologies 

- Infeasible: no variables can achieve the constraints
- Feasible: Inverse of infeasible
- Global & Local optimal: (local) maximum beyond its neighbors; global is always local, but not vice versa

### The View of Gaming

*Everybody has its own objective, and what you achieve not only depends on what you do.*

Games are model for

- Competition
- Cooperation

*Description* (more complicated ***optimization problem*** - ***multi-agent optimization***)

- A set of **players**
- A **strategy space** for each player
- A **payoff** for each player

(ex. Prisoner's Dilemma)

|   P1 \ P2   |    Deny    |  Confess   |
| :---------: | :--------: | :--------: |
|  **Deny**   | ==-1==, -1 | ==-12==, 0 |
| **Confess** | ==0==, -12 | ==-6==, -6 |

*==(what P1 will get)==*

In this case, Confess is a ***strictly dominant strategy*** for player 1, as it always leads to the best payoff among all this strategies.

Prisoner's Dilemma is a ***symmetric game***, as confess is also a strictly dominant strategy for player 2. 

*Equilibrium:* Both of the players choose the best they can. In this case, (-6, -6) is the equilibrium, after the removal of all possible strategies except the strictly dominant strategy.

*Dilemma:* (-1, -1) achieves a better result than (-6, -6), thus the equilibrium leads to a ***lose-lose result***.

#### Best Response Strategies


$$
a^*(b) = \arg\max_{a\in\mathcal{A}} U_i(a, b)
$$

- Dominant Strategy
  - leads to a payoff **no worse** than his any other strategies, **independent** of his opponent options
  - **Strictly** dominant and **weakly** dominant (best payoff depends by other strategies at different time)

---

### Nash Equilibrium

- Players: $X = \{0, 1, 2, ..., I\}$
- Strategy: $x_i\in\mathcal{X}_i$
- Payoff: $u_i (x_i, x_{-i})$ where $x_i = (x_1, ..., x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_I)$

#### View of DPC

- Players: $X$
- Strategy Space: $p_i\in [0, p_i^\max], SIR_i(p_i, p_{-i}) \geq \gamma_i, \forall $

- Payoff: $\min p_i, \forall i$

```
Remark on Equilibrium:
Existence? Uniqueness? Type of optimality?

### Summary of C1

- Different users' signals interfere with each other in the air
  - Feasible SIR region with a Pareto-optimal boundary
- Interference coordination in CDMA uses DPC with feedback
  - Solves an optimization problem in the form of Linear Programming problem
  - Or viewed as the best response updates of a non-cooperative game

### Online Ad Space Policies

- Impression-based
- Clicked-based
- Auction-based *The ad space will be given to those who are willing to pay the most*

#### Spots and Corresponding Values

Let expected clickthrough rate to be characterized as $C$ *(assuming C is independent of the content of the ad.)*

#### Q1. How do advertisers pay Google?

- Based on ==***actually click***== of the netizens

#### Q2. How do advertisers evaluate the return?

> The valuation of the ad space to the buyer, and ***Google does not need to know the evaluation of its customers.***

- Revenue depends on
  - $C$: average click per hour
  
  - $R$: average revenue per click
  
  - $C\times R$: average revenue in dollar per hour

### Auction

- 1 seller *(Google)* 
- $N$ Buyers *(advertisers)* -- submit bids
- $K$ items *(ad spaces)*

#### Single Item Public Auction

- Ascending price
- Descending price

#### Single Item Sealed Envelope

 *sealed envelope: blindness of others' price*

- First Price *(Highest bidder pays the highest bid)*
- Second Price *(Highest bidder pays the second highest bid)*

#### Multiple Items

- ==Generalized Second Price **(GSP)**==
- Vickrey-Clarke-Groves

#### Objectives of Each Party

- Seller: revenue
- Buyers: payoff
  - Difference between valuation and payment
- Auction designer
  - Efficiency and fairness
  - Truthful bidding

#### Auction as A Game*

- Set of Players: $\mathcal{N}$

- Strategy space: $b_i \geq 0$

- Payoff function per player

  - For the bidder win the auction

    - Payoff: $U_i(\textbf{b}) = v_i - p_i(b)$

    - Payment $p_i$ depends on everyone's ***bidding behavior*** (vector $b$) 

      and the ***auction rule*** (function $p_i(*)$)

  - For the bidder does not win
  
    - Payoff: $U_i(\textbf{b}) = 0$
