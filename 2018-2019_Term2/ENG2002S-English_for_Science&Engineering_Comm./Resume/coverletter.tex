I found your posting on the jobs.amazon.com for a software develop engineer and immediately knew I would like to apply. Amazon Web Service's reputation for diverse business and excellent performance supports differentiates your company from the rest, and I sincerely hope to be part of your software develop team.

I will be graduated from CUHK(SZ) this May with a Bachelor of Engineering in computer science. During the four-year studying in the college, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the laboratory of IoT and supervised by Professor Shenghao, YANG. In this role, I am valued as a productive engineer, no matter in designing of the architecture, or in implementation of the project. My colleagues and schoolmates rated me as a trouble-shooter with great execution during the development of projects. I am methodical and meticulous in solving problems both in software and hardware.

I have experience in all areas required in your job ad, which consists of:
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Extensive Experience in C/C++, Python and Swift 
	\item Complexity and Scale Analysis on Computation Algorithms
	\item Familiar with UNIX/Linux Operation Systems
	\item Distributed Systems and Distributed Storage
	\item Mathematical Optimization on Specific Problems
	\item Computer Architecture and Computer Systems
\end{itemize}

As a computer science student, I have great passion in learning new skills and exploring unknown fields. I am dedicated to providing solid plans on the architect of software and constructing the software with both coherency and efficiency. 

Joining AWS is challenging for a student who are going to graduate from school, but I am extremely excited to solve problems I have never met and to gain experience from them. I am confident I would quickly adapt to the new position as a software develop engineer in Amazon Web Service. If you would like to accept my application, please call me at (+86) 137-9943-0816 to set up an interview.

Looking forward to your reply, 

\makeletterclosing
